analysis of health data from samsung fitness app using R

This file consist the data imported from samsung fitness app. all the code written in R.
For this project i installed some new packages from library. eg: data.table,psych

i have written code for all 5 questions. i analyze both testing and training data in txt format.
Then i merge both testing and training data set in a single data frame. 
Then i reduce the number of variables usinn mean and standard deviation on different variables.
then i rename the variables according to question. Then i create a tidy dataset to with 0 observation and 81 variables according to question using FALSE.
